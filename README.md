# Interactive Number Guesser
### Credits: https://towardsdatascience.com/handwritten-digit-mnist-pytorch-977b5338e627

This project contains a graphical user interface (GUI) for a user to draw a number on a panel and for a trained Artificial Intelligence Model to guess what number was outputted to the screen. The model was trained on the MNIST database, containing a plethora of differently handwritten digits from 0-9.

Getting inspiration from a video posted by YouTube TechWithTim and the above article, I decided to try this on my own.
